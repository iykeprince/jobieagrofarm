                    Jobie Agro Farm was born in 2022 with the aim to serve the l

                    Itukpa in Abia State Nigeria. Jobie farm initiative was
                    derived after a terror marketing research on how difficult
                    small farmer owner struggled to order day old chicks and
                    eggs down to hatching different kinds of eggs. We operate in

                    necessary. The traditional methods being used in farming
                    have to go away to pave the way for modern methods. Jobie
                    Agro farms is just a beginning for all the other farms that
                    will adapt to the innovative ways of farming.
